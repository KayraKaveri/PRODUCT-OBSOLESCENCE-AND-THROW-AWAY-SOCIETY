# PRODUCT-OBSOLESCENCE-AND-THROW-AWAY-SOCIETY

For the purpose of this study, we selected a sample of 120 people, from our target
population of individuals in the age group of 18 and above with an equal number (25%) of
individuals in each age group. We ensured a 1:1 ratio of female to male respondents. We
made use of non-probability sampling techniques, namely Convenience Sampling and
Snowball Sampling. We made use of Google Forms to collect responses. The forms were sent
to be filled via the social media platform WhatsApp to our friends, family and acquaintances
that satisfied our requirements. The respondents were then asked to forward the form to other
people who belong to the target population.

Our main parameters of interest for the analysis are the most prominent type of obsolescence,
purchase frequency of the respondents, factors influencing purchase decision,
factors influencing replacement decision, monthly income, age group and proportion of
people aware about obsolescence and proportion of people willing to adopt durability over
frequent upgrades considering the obstacles that may or may not entail with it.
Our survey included various qualitative as well as quantitative types of data which
required different types of analysis (such as chi-squared test, ANOVA, Mantel-Haenszel Test
and Karl Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient) which would be best to draw the conclusions that
we required. A certain amount of conceptual research as well as empirical research was
required to analyse the data. A lot of the tests that were used on the sample required a certain
amount of secondary data backing in order to draw certain conclusions for the population.

With reference to budget and time, there were no problems in carrying out the survey as
it was carried out through online modality which helps in speeding up the work and the
data becomes easier to analyse when it has been sorted into a spreadsheet database. All of
the responses have been analysed through Microsoft Excel with required and relevant data
tools.
